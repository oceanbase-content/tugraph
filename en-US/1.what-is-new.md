# What's New

This document describes the new features and modifications of OceanBase Call Interface (OBCI) V2.0.4.

## New features

* [libzdb] The `OCIMultiByteStrCaseConversion` API is supported.

* [libzdb] The `OCITransStart` function used for processing single-server transactions (without an XID) is supported.

* [Oracle compatibility] The OCILobCharSetForm, OCILobCreateTemporary, and OCILobWrite2 functions are supported. For more information, see [LOB functions](5.reference-function/5.lob-functions.md).

## Fixed issues

* Some issues occur when the password is empty.

* When DBMS_LOB.OBCI_WRITE lob payload is NULL, the error `ret=-4152` is returned.

* When the name of a placeholder contains the `collection mothods` keyword pre-defined on the server, the error code is added prior to the error message.

* When the OCIAttrGet function uses ub4 for intermediate conversion, an error is returned when the OCIParamGet function is executed.

> **Notice**
>
> Since OBCI V2.0.4, the `include` folder of the RPM package no longer contains header files such as oci.h and ociap.h. In this case, application compilation engineers must first install the RPM package of Oracle clntsh to directly use its header files.
