What's New 
===============================

OceanBase Call Interface (OBCI) V2.0.1 released in October 2021 updated the features that are compatible with Oracle and fixed issues such as a bug related to the TIMEDATE type. 

New features 
---------------------------------

* Arrays can be used as placeholders in PL/SQL statements.

  

* The following APIs are supported: OCIThreadTerm, OCIConnectionPoolCreate, OCIServerVersion, OCIThreadProcessInit, OCIThreadInit, OCIThreadCreate, and OCIConnectionPoolDestroy.

  

* Implicit conversion based on the nls_date_format variable is supported. This is consistent with Oracle. 

  **Notice**

  

  The updated features are supported for only OBCI V2.x.x.
  




Bug fixes 
------------------------------

* The issue is fixed where a core file-related error is reported when a parameter of the TIMEDATE type is set to 0.

  

* The issue is fixed where an error is reported when the connection obtained by calling the OCILogon2() function is released to the connection pool after an insert operation is performed.
