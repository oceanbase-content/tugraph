# What's New

This topic describes the new features and improvements of OceanBase Call Interface (OBCI) V2.1.0.

The Full-link Trace feature is added in this version. For more information, see [Full-link Trace](9.full-link/1.full-link-introduction.md).

> **Notice**
>
> * Since OBCI V2.0.4, the `include` folder of the RPM package no longer contains header files such as `oci.h` and `ociap.h`. In this case, application compilation engineers must first install the RPM package of Oracle clntsh to directly use its header files.
>
> * After obprotocol 20 is enabled, exceptions may occur during the sending and receiving of oversized network packets when OBProxy 4.0 is connected.
