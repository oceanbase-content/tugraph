# What's New

This topic describes the new features and updates of OceanBase Call Interface (OBCI) V2.0.5.

## New features

* OBCI supports the SQLT_UIN type.

* OCIBindByPos and OCIDefineByPos support the OCI_IOV object information.

* OBCI supports the SQLEnvGet and SQLSvcCtxGet functions for compatibility with Oracle. For more information, see [Functions related to SQL environment operations](8.reference-function/16.sql-environment-operation-functions.md).

## Fixed issues

The return value is not supported when XaTransCommit is executed after XATransDetch.

## Known risks

OCIParamGet occasionally accesses released memory, causing the `Invalid read of size 1 core dump` error.

> **Notice**
>
> Since OBCI V2.0.4, the `include` folder of the RPM package no longer contains header files such as `oci.h` and `ociap.h`. In this case, application compilation engineers must first install the RPM package of Oracle clntsh to directly use its header files.
