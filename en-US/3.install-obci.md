Install OBCI 
=================================



Prerequisites 
----------------------------------

* Operating system: Linux (el7.x86_64, el6.x86_64, or aarch64).

  

* Compiler: GCC V4.8.

  

* OceanBase Database: V2.2.76 or later. We recommend that you use OceanBase Database V3.2 or later. Otherwise, you cannot use all features of OceanBase Call Interface (OBCI).

  

* OceanBase Database Proxy (ODP, or OBProxy): V1.8.7 or later.

  

* libobclient V2.1.1 or later.

  

* OBCI is installed, and the GCC compiler is deployed. 

  **Note**

  
  * We recommend that you use OBServer and OBProxy of the latest version. Otherwise, you cannot use all features of OBCI.

    
  
  * OBCI V2.0.1 is compatible with all features of OBCI V1.2.2.

    
  

  
  




Installation instructions 
----------------------------------------------

OBCI publishes software in the form of RedHat Package Manager (RPM) packages. An OBCI package contains the header file and library files of the OCI runtime library libobci, together with a sample program. 

After you obtain the RPM package, run the following command in the command-line tool as the root user:

```javascript
rpm -ivh obci-<version>.x86_64.rpm
```



By default, the programs and files in the software package are installed in the following paths:

* The header file is installed in the `/u01/obclient/include` path.

  

* The library files are installed in the `/u01/obclient/lib` path.

  




Usage notes 
--------------------------------

OBCI is a C language call interface provided by OceanBase. It provides complete features that are compatible with OCI. 

If you want to use a C application written by using Oracle OCI, you need only to specify the OBCI library as the runtime library when you perform linking. By default, library files are installed in the `/u01/obclient/lib` path. 
**Note**



If you are creating a dynamic link to libobci.so, you also need to manually install the OBClient RPM package.
If you are creating a static link to libobci.a, the OBClient RPM package is not required.

For more information about linking, see [Basic development procedure](/zh-CN/6.developer-guide/1.basic-steps-of-development.md).
